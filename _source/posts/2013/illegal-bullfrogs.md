Summary: The problem with non-standard data licenses
Status: draft

Last week, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) launched their [new awesome data portal](http://www.gbif.org/). One of the things I like most is that the record limit on downloads has been lifted, so we now have free and open access to all 415+ occurrence records GBIF aggregates. GBIF also makes an effort to lower the barrier to correctly attribute the data publishers, by providing extensive metadata and a citation suggestion in each data download.

That doesn't mean however that it is actually easy to legally use the data, [something GBIF is well aware of](filename|gbif-data-license.md). As a test, I downloaded all [13,297 georeferenced American bullfrog records](http://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?GEOREFERENCED=true&SPATIAL_ISSUES=false&TAXON_KEY=2427091) and would like to visualize and share these on a map using [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com). Technically, this would only take me a few minutes, but to make sure I'm not violating any restrictions, I need to take a closer look at the fine print.

## 65 data licenses

By downloading data from GBIF, I agree with the [data use agreement](http://www.gbif.org/disclaimer/datause), which states among other things: 

> * Users must comply with additional terms and conditions of use set by the Data Publisher. Where these exist they will be available through the metadata associated with the data.

Indeed, GBIF includes metadata for each dataset included in my download and a file with all the rights as supplied by the data publishers (`rights.txt`). Since my download aggregates records from 65 data publishers, I have to read and understand 65 rights statements before I can use the data[^1].

[^1]: Sadly, these rights are not attached to the data itself (maybe to prevent file size bloat), so I had to manually match (with some help of [Open Refine](http://openrefine.org/)) each `dataset_id` with the metadata in order to have the rights per record.

## Standard data licenses

Four datasets are provided with a standard data license (e.g. [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/)) and thus easy to understand:

License | # of datasets | # of records | % of records
--- | --- | --- | ---
[CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) | 2 ([1](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/8c201186-d997-4b65-aac9-2fcf442a93f6) & [1](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/cc28549b-467f-448c-875e-881ca507aba8)) | 543 | 4.08%
[CC-BY-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) | [1](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/b70121ef-b7ea-4316-a05b-abdf30f5ca09) | 4 | 0.03%
[CC-BY-NC-SA](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) | [1](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/94dce9c1-e2f0-45cb-a77b-8e5caa871a41) | 1 | 0.01%
Non-standard license | 61 | 12.749 | 95.88%

## Interpreting the other licenses

I am entering unknown legal territory by interpreting the non-standard licenses, but since I would like to create an occurrence map with more than 4% of the data, I'll try anyway.

24 datasets don't supply rights, so I could either interpret this as: 1) I'm free to use these data under the general GBIF data use agreement, or 2) I don't want to risk violating any applicable copyright or database rights, so I won't use these data.

Some I interpreted as *Non-commercial use only* (1 dataset, 22 records), *Non-commercial use with attribution only* (5 datasets, 3190 records), *Public domain* (1 dataset, 1 record) or *All rights reserved* (1 dataset, 1 record: seriously [Royal Belgian Institute for Natural Sciences](http://www.gbif.org/dataset/8138eb72-f762-11e1-a439-00145eb45e9a)?). For 3 datasets (373 records) it was unclear to me what the license allowed. The bulk of the data however (26 datasets, 6894 records) have rights of the form (emphasis mine):

> [Institution A] data records may be used by individual researchers or research groups, but **they may not be repackaged, resold, or redistributed in any form without the express written consent** of a curatorial staff member of [Institution A]. If any of these records are used in an analysis or report, the provenance of the original data must be acknowledged and [Institution A] notified. [Institution A] and its staff are not responsible for damages, injury or loss due to the use of these data.

â€¦ or something along the same lines, which I interpreted as *Some use with attribution only, no redistribution*.
