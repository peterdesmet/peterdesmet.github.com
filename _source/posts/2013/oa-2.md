Summary: Figuring out how open access my paper is

*Note: This post is written as a response to [this task](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/content/366/) of an [online course on open science](https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/open-science-an-introduction/) I am following.*

In my [previous post](|filename|oa-1.md), I explained what open access is. But we can go beyond the simple question of "Is it open access?" and evaluate how open a resource actually is.

PLOS, SPARC and OASPA developed a [2-page guide](http://www.plos.org/about/open-access/howopenisit/) to do just that. I will use it to assess the openness of [my first paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/phytokeys.25.3100) that was published in PhytoKeys two weeks ago. Not as a vanity project, but to figure out how well I - as an advocate for open - am doing by submitting my paper to PhytoKeys as the journal.
